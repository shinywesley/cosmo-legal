        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="small">Effective Date: 2026-01-07</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance and Acknowledgment</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Cosmo mobile application and any
          related services, features, content, websites, and applications (collectively, the “Service”).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>By tapping “Get Started,”</strong> creating an account (if applicable), purchasing a subscription or
          credits, or otherwise accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree
          to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility; Minors</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. If you are under 18, you may use the Service
          only with the permission and direct supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these
          Terms on your behalf. You represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>3. No Professional Advice</h2>
        <p>
          The Service may generate text, images, or other outputs using artificial intelligence. Outputs are provided for
          informational and entertainment purposes only and are not professional advice. Do not rely on the Service for
          medical, legal, financial, safety-critical, or other professional decisions. You are solely responsible for your
          use of the Service and any decisions or actions you take based on outputs.
        </p>

        <h2>4. AI-Generated Content; No Guarantees</h2>
        <p>
          AI-generated content may be inaccurate, misleading, offensive, non-unique, or otherwise undesirable. We do not
          guarantee that outputs will be correct, unique, non-infringing, or suitable for any purpose. You understand and
          agree that you use the Service and any outputs at your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Your Content; License</h2>
        <p>
          You may provide prompts, images, or other content (“Inputs”). You retain any rights you may have in your Inputs.
          To operate the Service, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to host,
          store, process, reproduce, modify, and transmit your Inputs solely to provide, maintain, secure, and improve the
          Service, to comply with law, and to enforce these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
          <li>
            Attempt to bypass usage limits, credits, subscriptions, paywalls, security measures, or any access controls.
          </li>
          <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code or underlying models.</li>
          <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service, including abuse of APIs or infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Submit unlawful, harmful, harassing, defamatory, or infringing content.</li>
          <li>Generate or distribute content that exploits or harms minors.</li>
          <li>Impersonate any person or entity, or misrepresent your affiliation.</li>
          <li>Use the Service to build or provide competing products or services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Subscriptions, Purchases, and Credits</h2>
        <p>
          The Service may offer subscriptions and consumable credit packs. Purchases are processed through Apple’s In-App
          Purchase system (and/or authorized providers for purchase management).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscriptions</strong>: may auto-renew unless cancelled in your Apple account settings. Pricing,
            billing periods, and included entitlements are shown at purchase time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credits</strong>: credit packs are consumables and generally do not expire, but may be subject to
            technical or policy constraints. Image generation may require credits or an active subscription, and limits
            may apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Restoring Purchases</strong>: you can restore eligible purchases using the in-app restore feature or
            Apple’s standard mechanisms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          All sales are final to the fullest extent permitted by law. Refunds and cancellations are handled by Apple and
          are subject to Apple’s policies. Nothing in these Terms limits any rights you may have under applicable consumer
          protection laws.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Service, including its software, design, text, graphics, trademarks, and other content (excluding your
          Inputs), is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy,
          modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service unless we give you written permission.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Service may rely on third-party services (including AI model providers, analytics, payment processors, and
          hosting). We are not responsible for third-party services and do not control their content, policies, or
          practices.
        </p>

        <h2>11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF
          ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED,
          SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.
        </p>

        <h2>12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS,
          SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE
          DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR
          RELATED TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICE OR ANY OUTPUTS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL NOT
          EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO USE THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE
          CLAIM (OR $10 IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANY AMOUNT).
        </p>

        <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers,
          and licensors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable
          attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your Inputs; (c) your violation
          of these Terms; or (d) your violation of any law or third-party right.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for any reason, including if we believe you
          violated these Terms or created risk for us, other users, or third parties. You may stop using the Service at
          any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify the Service and these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we may provide notice
          within the app or otherwise. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes your
          acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Governing Law; Disputes</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by applicable laws of the jurisdiction where we are established, without regard to
          conflict-of-law principles. You agree to resolve any disputes in the courts of that jurisdiction unless
          applicable law provides otherwise. Nothing in these Terms limits any rights you may have under applicable law.
        </p>
