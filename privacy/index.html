        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="small">Last updated: 2026-01-07</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how Cosmo (“Cosmo,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects
          information when you use our mobile application and related services (the “Service”). By using the Service, you
          agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect the following categories of information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Content you provide (Inputs)</strong>: prompts you type, and images you choose to upload (for example,
            reference images for image-to-image generation).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Generated outputs</strong>: images produced by the Service as a result of your prompts and/or uploaded
            images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase and subscription data</strong>: information needed to validate subscriptions and credit-pack
            purchases (processed through Apple In‑App Purchase and our purchase management provider). We do not receive or
            store your full payment card details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device and app information</strong>: basic technical information such as device type, OS version,
            app version, language, and diagnostic information needed to operate and improve the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage information</strong>: actions within the app such as feature usage, credit consumption, and
            error events (primarily for reliability and abuse prevention).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Permissions (Photos/Camera)</h2>
        <p>
          If you enable certain features, the app may request permissions such as Photos and Camera. You can decline these
          permissions; however, some features (like uploading a reference image) may not work without them.
        </p>

        <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide the Service, including generating images from your prompts and uploaded images.</li>
          <li>Operate, maintain, secure, and improve the Service.</li>
          <li>Prevent abuse, fraud, and attempts to bypass credits/subscription limits.</li>
          <li>Process subscriptions and consumable credit packs, including purchase verification and restoration.</li>
          <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries.</li>
          <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>
          We may share information only as needed to run the Service:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AI / infrastructure providers</strong>: to generate outputs and deliver the Service (for example,
            sending prompts and images to our backend and model providers).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase/subscription providers</strong>: to validate subscriptions and purchases (for example, Apple
            and a purchase management provider such as RevenueCat).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service providers</strong>: hosting, logging, analytics, and security providers that help us operate
            the Service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal and safety</strong>: if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity of the
            Service and users.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>We do not sell your personal information.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain information for as long as needed to provide the Service, meet legal obligations, resolve disputes,
          enforce agreements, and improve reliability and security. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of
          data and why it is processed.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. No system is
          perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is intended for users 18 and older. If a minor uses the Service, they must have permission and
          supervision from a parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
          without appropriate consent. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will
          take appropriate steps.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Your Choices</h2>

        <h2>10. International Users</h2>
        <p>
          If you use the Service from outside the United States, your information may be processed in countries where our
          service providers operate. These countries may have different data protection laws than your country of
          residence.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date above shows when it was most
          recently revised. Your continued use of the Service after updates means you accept the revised policy.
